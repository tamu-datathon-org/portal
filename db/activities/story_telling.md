In this talk, we will describe how we use data collected at Facebook to inform product development. Including everything from ideas, experimentations, and launches.

Learning the technical skills for analysis is key, but arguably more critical is asking the right research questions for the data you have available, and creating a story out of your findings.

Our talk will include an example of how an analysis can influence a product, as well as open up a discussion to everyone in the audience to share their own experiences. Hope to see you there!
