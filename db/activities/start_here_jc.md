Are you wanting to get started in the field of data science? But perhaps you feel overwhelmed by the information out there on the subject? Honestly, It's a lot. Well you came to the right place. This 4 hour course is for beginners in data science. I give you the tools you need to get started in this exciting field. Here's some of the things we will cover. We will cover how to handle large data using a Python package named Pandas. We'll learn to visualize the data with Matplotlib.  And we'll apply machine learning to the data with sklearn. These three libraries are ubiquitous in data science and you need to know them! As a bit of a bonus, through this introductory course, you will also complete and walk away with your own data science project which will look great on your resume and linkedin. We're going to teach you how to tell a complete story with data, which is what companies really care about. This course is great for anyone but it will especially help you get a jump start for TAMU Datathon 2020. So yeah, you won't want to miss out! I hope to see you there ðŸ˜ƒ
