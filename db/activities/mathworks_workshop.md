MATLAB is a professionally developed programming environment with a variety of toolboxes for engineers and scientists. Join Connell D’Souza as he walks through how MATLAB can help you solve problems without getting bogged down by implementation issues. We will cover the basics of importing and visualizing data, rapidly testing machine learning and deep learning models as well as building apps in MATLAB.
