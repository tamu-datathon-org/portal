presenter: Ankit Ramchandani
presenterAbout: Ankit is currently researching deep learning to predict the spread of COVID-19 in the US using several heterogenous features. He has also interned at Facebook in an applied machine learning team to create models to rank Facebook stories and researched in autonomous driving and detected lane marks and traffic signs using machine learning.

I will start by talking about the convolution operation, the motivation of choosing it over others, and the basics of convolutional neural networks (convolutional layer, pooling layers).

I will then briefly go over the architecture of a famous convolution network. I will end by talking about some applications and sharing a Colab notebook of at least one convolutional network for semantic segmentation (using [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/)).

If time permits and people are interested, I will be happy to touch on some pertinent advanced topics like transpose convolutions etc.
