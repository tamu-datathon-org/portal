Did you know that all machine learning is really just optimization? When you attend this talk, you'll learn the math behind how computer’s “learn” and get to experiment yourself with code!

You'll learn one of the most popular and successful machine learning algorithms called Random Forests. We will apply the algorithm through a Python package called sklearn to analyze and predict on a real data set!

Finally, we'll learn how to avoid overfitting through cross validation, hyperparameter tuning and feature importance. Looking forward to seeing you there!
