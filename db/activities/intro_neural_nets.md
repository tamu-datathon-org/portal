You’ll walk away from this workshop with the basics of neural networks. You’ll be able to get your hands dirty with some of the software tools that are used to build neural networks like sklearn/keras/tensorflow. Additionally, you’ll become comfortable with many commonly heard terms of machine learning at a high level (more concept, less math) such as:
hidden layers, edges, nodes
backwards propagation (optimization)
forward propagation
activation function
loss function
learning rate
gradient decent
minibatches
epochs
