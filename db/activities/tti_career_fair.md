### ABOUT TTI
The Texas A&M Transportation Institute (TTI) is honored to once again sponsor the Texas A&M Datathon. The amazing and energetic student organizers have risen to the challenge of a virtual Datathon and I expect that it will be even more successful than last year! We are always looking for talented data scientists who want to help solve real-world transportation problems with data.
