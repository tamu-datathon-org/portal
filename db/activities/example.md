You can add a description here to give more information on what exactly your workshop is about. This is a **markdown** area, so you can put whatever kind of content here.

Participants will read the description here and decide whether to attend your workshop, _so it's important to make this enticing_. 

We can also add a "video trailer" which is a great way to further convince particpants to attend your workshop.

Here are some examples of workshop trailers:

* [Data Science at Facebook](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I2_h6xJ7kNQ "Data Science at Facebook")
* [Getting started with Data Science](https://youtube.com/watch?v=ysfoSauXpq0)
* [Intro to Machine Learning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3eJoJUJlkWg)

Links to code samples or your slides is another great way to let attendees refer to your materials before and after your workshop.

Images and embeds can be added here as well.
