In this workshop, I am going to take you to the fascinating journey into unsupervised clustering algorithms.

First I discuss the ill-posed definition of clustering. Next, I will discuss major clustering algorithms followed by their application on real and complex data set in R or Python. 

The goal of this talk is to understand the intuition behind these algorithms so that we can gauge their limitations.
