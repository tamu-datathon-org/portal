Let us dive into the world of transportation with Texas A&M Transportation Institute (TTI). Attend this workshop to learn about who we are, what we do, and how you can fit in this world of transportation research with your data science skills. Transportation is a very diverse field with multiple modes – cars, trucks, bikes, buses, multiple focus areas – safety, pavement/road material, policy, air quality, and hence, comes with a multitude of real-world problems waiting to be solved. Join us to learn how we geek out on data while saving lives, time, and resources.
