In this workshop, we will delve into four cutting-edge projects:

1) Traffic Analysis via Monitoring Videos, leveraging computer vision to analyze traffic patterns and pedestrian movements, particularly post-major events like football games;

2) Rapid Damage Estimation using social media data, where we employ geotagged posts and a deep neural network to estimate disaster damage, tested during Winter Storm Uri;

3) Precision Livestock Farming, which uses computer vision to optimize livestock management, demonstrating an 81% accuracy in identifying beef cattle feeding events;

4) C.difficile Spore Detection in confocal images, aiming to automate the time-consuming process of annotating these spores, crucial for understanding and treating the infection.
