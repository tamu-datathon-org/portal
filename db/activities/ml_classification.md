In this workshop we will take you though one of the most powerful ML algorithms: Decision Trees. We will follow that up with a form of bagging called Random Forests and then a form of boosting called XGBoost.
Finally, weâ€™ll teach how to avoid overfitting through cross validation, hyperparameter tuning and feature selection. All of this will be done in Python with sklearn. Looking forward to seeing you there!
