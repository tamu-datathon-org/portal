In my talk I'll be covering how to apply for a data science job this one could had to build projects for a data science portfolio, how to structure your resume, and how to reach out to people effectively.

I will also talk about how to optimize your LinkedIn profile, and finally how to decide what data skills to learn. Most of this will center on how one can make projects and I'll show some quick examples on how to get interactive work online for a recruiter or someone that you're interviewing with to see.
